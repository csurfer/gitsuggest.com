    One quick way to level up as a programmer, is by reading code written by
    smart people. GitHub is a treasure trove of such repositories. However, at
    the end of the day, we all are interested in our own specific areas and we
    express this interest by “starring” repositories on GitHub.<br><br>

    This is a tool which uses the repositories you have starred to help you
    discover other GitHub repositories which might be of interest to
    you.<br><br>

    This is a pet project of a philomath and in no way associated
    with <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
